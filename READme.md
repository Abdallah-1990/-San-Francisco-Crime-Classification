In this Project, I used PySpark to predict what type of crime will occur in a given region with prepared code for Kaggle submission 

https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/overview

Have been applied cycle composed of the following steps:

1. Data Exploration for understanding the variables and create intuition on the data.
2. Feature Engineering to create additional variables from the existing.
3. Data Transformation for preparing the dataset for the learning algorithms.
4. Training / Testing data creation to evaluate the performance of your models and fine-tune their hyperparameters.
5. Model selection and evaluation. This will be the final goal; creating a model that
   predicts the probability of each type of crime based on the location and the date.
